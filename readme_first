I am the developer of this project. Initially, I created it for my resume, but it completely failed. However, it works on my local machine.
I don't know if it will work for you, but you can try running it on your local setup.

It works, but please don't change anything because I also don't know exactly how it works. Just download the voice_assistant.py file; you don't need to download the other .py files because they
were written by Cursor AI tools. While they function similarly to my code, they also work independently in their own way.

Lastly, the HTML, CSS, and JS files, as well as app.py, were also written by AI, so they might not work properly.

If you want to connect with me, here’s my email: gauravsin333@gmail.com and gauravsin350@gmail.com. If I don't reply to your email, don't worry—I'm just lazy, but I promise I will eventually get back to you.
